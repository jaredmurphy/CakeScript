# GravyScript
A Javascript library which uses prototyping to allow more convenient object methods, like those you see in Ruby. 

## Installation
* Download the gravyscript.js file
* Include gravyscript.js in your html <script></script> tags AFTER jQuery and BEFORE any script file that would depend on GravyScript methods

## Example Usage
#### array.sample();
* array.sample() takes an array and returns a random item in the array
```javascript 
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.sample();
=> 3
```
