# CakeScript
A Javascript library which uses prototyping to allow more convenient object methods, like those you see in Ruby. This is an on going project, and I add new features as often as possible. Please use the [wiki] (https://github.com/jaredmurphy/CakeScript/wiki) to find methods and their descriptions. 

## Installation
* Download the cakescript.js file
* Include cakescript.js in your html `<script></script>` tags AFTER jQuery and BEFORE any script file that would depend on GravyScript methods

## Example Usage
#### array.sample();
* array.sample() takes an array and returns a random item in the array
```javascript 
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.sample();
=> 3
```
Please see [CakeScript Wiki] (https://github.com/jaredmurphy/CakeScript/wiki) for specific documentation for all CakeScript methods.
